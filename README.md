# Classification on Musk dataset

This dataset describes a set of 102 molecules of which 39 are judged by human experts to be musks and the remaining 63 molecules are judged to be non-musks.

The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks

To perform this task, simple logistic regression has been used, which has been implemented from scratch.
